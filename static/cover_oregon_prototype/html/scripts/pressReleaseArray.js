        Content: ["<p><b>Durham, Ore.</b> – Cover Oregon and the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) today announced the first round of outreach and enrollment grants to 30 community-based organizations from around the state, totaling $3.16 million. The grantees will help Oregon individuals and families enroll in health insurance.</p>" +
         "<p>The community-based outreach program is designed to reach Oregonians in every corner of the state so they know the choices available to them through Cover Oregon. It is projected that more than 350,000 Oregonians will enroll in private health insurance through Cover Oregon, or will enroll in the Oregon Health Plan and/or Healthy Kids in 2014. The community partners will also make sure people can access financial help available only through Cover Oregon.</p>" +
         "<p>“Up to now many Oregonians have been challenged to find health coverage because of pre-existing conditions, premium cost or the inability to navigate the current system,” said Liz Baxter, chair of the Cover Oregon board of directors. “Our goal is to make sure that no matter where they live, or what assistance they need, they can find out what coverage options are available.”</p>" +
         "<p>To ensure enrollment is as easy and seamless as possible on Oct. 1 and into the future, Oregonians will be directed to apply through Cover Oregon certified community partners, including the grantees announced today, as well as insurance agents for the first few weeks in October. Later in October, customers will be able to apply on their own through CoverOregon.com, if they desire.</p>" +
         "<p>Over the past year, Cover Oregon has trained more than 1,200 employees at community-based organizations and nearly 1,600 insurance agents to help Oregonians enroll through Cover Oregon. Three additional grant opportunities for small business outreach, provider outreach, and general outreach, funded by Cover Oregon, closed Aug. 28, 2013 and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>" +
         "<p>“These organizations are trusted members of their communities and understand the unique needs of the people they serve,” said Bruce Goldberg, M.D., director of OHA.</p>" +
         "<p>These grants complement the statewide marketing campaign by providing on-the-ground outreach and enrollment assistance from local organizations. The grantees awarded include groups that serve diverse populations, remote communities, people living with mental illness and a wide range of social service agencies.</p>" +
         "<p>Cover Oregon is a one-stop shop where people can enroll in private health insurance plans, the Oregon Health Plan and Healthy Kids. If Oregonians apply for private health insurance before Dec. 15, coverage will begin January 2014.</p>" +
         "<p>Working with community partners and agents is free and Oregonians will be able to go to CoverOregon.com or call 1-855-CoverOR (1-855-268-3767) on or before Oct. 1 to be connected to a community partner in their area or to verify that the partner or agent they are currently working with is certified.</p>" +
         "<p>OHA and Cover Oregon are working together to administer the outreach and enrollment grant program. In addition to these grants, there are also options for organizations to volunteer to assist. To be a certified community partner, staff and volunteers at partner organizations must:</p>" +
         "<ul><li>Complete a prerequisite online Cover Oregon overview</li><li>Attend an in-person enrollment assistance training and pass a certification exam as well as any future required trainings</li><li>Be covered by the organization’s general liability and automobile insurance</li><li>Have a clean/current criminal history check on file</li></ul>" +

                "<p>Durham, Ore. – Thousands of individuals, families and small businesses in Oregon are getting ready to sign up for health insurance and financial help through Cover Oregon–– a new online marketplace where Oregonians can compare and enroll in medical and dental insurance that fits their needs and budget, and access financial help––this fall. Starting Oct. 1, individuals and small businesses will be able to apply for health insurance through an agent or community partner, including Tribal organizations, who has been certified with Cover Oregon. Later in October, Oregonians will be able to apply online without the assistance of community partners or agents, if desired.</p>" +
                "<p>With any new high-profile program, there are scam artists who take advantage of change or confusion. Cover Oregon, the Oregon Department of Justice and the Oregon Insurance Division warn that people may pose as Cover Oregon representatives to collect fraudulent fees, sell fake insurance or steal personal identity. Some imposters may prey on the elderly by asking for personal information because of upcoming changes to Medicare.</p>" +
                "<p>“We’re committed to helping Oregonians distinguish between the real Cover Oregon and scammers looking to take advantage of people,” says Howard “Rocky” King, executive director of Cover Oregon. “Using our online marketplace and working with our certified community partners and agents is safe and convenient. If you’re ever in doubt, stop and call us to be sure you’re in good hands.”</p>" +
                "<p>To empower consumers to keep their information safe and avoid fraud, Cover Oregon, in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Justice and the Oregon Insurance Division, recommends the following tips for consumers:</p>" +
                "<ul><li><b>Do not pay for help.</b> There is no charge to use Cover Oregon services, either online or with the help of a certified agent or community partner. If consumers receive an offer to sign up on Cover Oregon for a fee, they should hang up the phone or walk away. Consumers should not give their credit card or banking information to anyone they do not know or did not contact.</li>" +
                "<li><b>Make sure you are working with a certified Cover Oregon agent or community partner.</b> Cover Oregon has certified insurance agents and community partners to help with enrollment – there is no charge for services. Referrals to trained, certified representatives will be available before October 1. Consumers can access this service by calling <b>1-855-CoverOR</b> (1-855-268-3767) or visiting <a href='http://www.coveroregon.com/'>CoverOregon.com.</a> to find help in their area. Information is available in multiple languages.  Consumers are advised to write down and keep the name, company, phone number, mailing address, email address and website of anyone who assists them.</li>" +
                "<li><b>Protect health care and financial information.</b> Cover Oregon will never visit or call people unannounced to ask for their Social Security number, credit card, or personal health information. Consumers should not share personal, financial or Medicare information with anyone they do not know even if they only ask you to confirm your information.</li>" +
                "<li><b>Cover Oregon does not offer Medicare.</b> Cover Oregon has no impact on Medicare and consumers cannot enroll in Medicare through Cover Oregon. Consumers should not share their Medicare number or other personal information with anyone who contacts them uninvited. For questions, contact Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</li>" +
                "<li><b>Remember that you can ONLY get tax credits through Cover Oregon.</b> Oregonians who purchase insurance through Cover Oregon may qualify for tax credits to help cut the cost. No one but Cover Oregon can offer these credits, and there is no charge to apply for the credits.</li>" +
                "</ul>" +
                "<p>“We encourage Oregonians to follow these tips and this simple rule: STOP, CALL and CONFIRM,” says Ellen Klem, director of consumer outreach and education at the Oregon Department of Justice. “If something seems suspicious, stop and don’t share information. Call Cover Oregon or the Oregon Insurance Division and confirm whether an insurance company, agent, or other person is a certified Cover Oregon representative. Report any suspected fraud to the Oregon Department of Justice online at <a href='http://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer/Pages/index.aspx'>http://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer/Pages/index.aspx</a> or by phone at 1-877-877-9392.”</p>" +
                "<p>For more information, consumers may call Cover Oregon toll free at 1-855-CoverOR (855-268-3767). Consumers can also call the Oregon Insurance Division toll free at 1-888-877-4894, which can help confirm that an insurance company, agent, community partner or other person is a certified Cover Oregon representative.

                "<p>The two TV spots feature a the “Long Live Oregonians” anthem sung by Portland-based musician Matt Sheehy of Lost Lander, and an ode to Cover Oregon from folk singer Laura Gibson, a Coquille, Oregon-native who is currently touring with the Portland Cello Project. The campaign also includes TV and radio spots from Lifesavas, Vikesh Kapoor, Edna Vazquez (coming soon in Spanish language) and Dave Depper, as well as artwork from artists across the state.</p>" +
                "<p>“It was really important to us that we kept this true to Oregon. We were reminded by the song that Bonneville Power Administration asked Woody Guthrie to write to help explain how the Bonneville Dam would benefit Oregonians,” said Mark Ray, creative director for Cover Oregon’s advertising agency, NORTH. “We were inspired. We asked local artists to be a part of this movement and, in that way, were able to put dollars back into the Oregon artist community and into a population of people who are traditionally uninsured.”</p>" +
                "<p>In total, the first phase of the advertising campaign, including production and the media buy, will cost approximately $3.2 million. The second phase of the campaign which begins in October will focus on enrolling Oregonians in health coverage by directing them to CoverOregon.com.</p>" +
                "<p>Cover Oregon will also be funding community-based organizations throughout the state to conduct outreach and enrollment assistance to hard-to-reach populations. Other grants are going to business associations to assist with small business outreach, provider organizations to conduct enrollment assistance in clinics and Tribal partners. Cover Oregon has also spoken at more than 80 conferences, meetings and events, and will continue to do this through the fall. In addition, Cover Oregon is training an estimated 1,5000 insurance agents in more than 60 trainings across the state.</p>" +

                "<p>Durham, Ore. – The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that 29 federally qualified Oregon community health centers would be eligible for an additional $2.8 million in outreach and enrollment grants to connect residents to Cover Oregon, the new online marketplace where Oregonians can compare and enroll in health coverage, set to open later this year.</p>" +
                "<p>“We are going to need all hands on deck to raise awareness about and get Oregonians enrolled in health coverage through Cover Oregon,” said Howard “Rocky” King, executive director for Cover Oregon. “Community health centers are a critical part of our outreach efforts and are trusted health care resources in their communities.”</p>" +
                "<p>Community health centers that are eligible for the grant (listed below) must submit applications to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) by May 31, 2013 in order to be considered for the grant. The funds will help heath centers hire new staff, train existing staff and conduct community outreach events and other educational activities. Community health centers have extensive experience in helping uninsured consumers apply for and enroll in health coverage. They can also connect consumers to information about the health plans available through Cover Oregon.</p>" +
                "<p>“Community health centers have always offered health care regardless of a customer’s ability to pay,” said Laurie Francis, senior director of clinic operations and quality with the Oregon Primary Care Association. “As a result, health centers are a natural and ideal place for individuals and families to learn about newly available health coverage options. Many of the customers our clinics serve are uninsured and, as with insured clients, they need help navigating the health care system. Our health centers look forward to working with Cover Oregon to connect more Oregonians to health coverage.”</p>" +
                "<p>The Oregon Primary Care Association represents all of the federally qualified health centers in the state and works with them to access and use grant funds. The grant supports the federal government’s efforts to enroll individuals, families and small businesses in new health insurance marketplaces created as part of the Affordable Care Act. It is estimated that about 217,000 Oregon residents will enroll in health coverage through Cover Oregon.</p>" +
                "<p>In addition to this federal grant administered by HRSA, Cover Oregon, in partnership with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), will award separate grants to community organizations this summer to conduct outreach and application assistance. The first request for these grant proposals closes May 16, and two more opportunities will open in the coming months (information available through ORPIN).</p>" +
                "<p>Community health centers eligible for the federal HRSA grant can also apply for the Cover Oregon/OHA grants. Health centers that are awarded both a HRSA grant and a Cover Oregon/OHA grant can either accept only one of the grants, or they will need to certify and demonstrate that they will not replace or duplicate funding for any activities within the scope of work of one grant with funding from the other. Cover Oregon and OHA will coordinate with all grantees for training and outreach support.</p>" +

                "<p>(Durham, Ore.) – Today, Cover Oregon––the state’s new online health insurance marketplace––announced the distribution of ten yearlong Business Organization Grants to business associations throughout the state of Oregon, totaling more than $604,000. The grants will help small businesses throughout Oregon find health insurance options that best fit the needs of their employees.</p>" +
                "<p>Through gatherings, videos, brochures, social media and other community approaches, grantees will reach out to members as well as other small businesses across the state. Grantees will explain the benefits and advantages of using Cover Oregon, the choices that exist for offering health insurance options to employees, as well as help employers identify the business tax credits for which they may qualify. Additionally, each association will invite members to provide feedback about Cover Oregon so that the marketplace can continually strengthen small business resources.</p>" +
                "<p>“Many businesses want to provide insurance for their employees or help their employees find insurance that works for them but have found the process to be cumbersome. Cover Oregon gives businesses an easy, cost-effective way to offer unprecedented choice to their employees,” said Amy Fauver, Chief Communication Officer at Cover Oregon. “We are excited to work with the grant recipients as they serve their communities.”</p>" +                
                "<p>One grantee, the Oregon Trucking Association (OTA), will use funds to reach the 7,500 trucking companies based around the state––the majority of which are small, locally owned businesses––with information about Cover Oregon and available cost savings. Like many small businesses, Oregon’s trucking industry often struggles to find affordable, quality health insurance options for workers. Due to the solitary conditions and transitory nature of the work, it can be hard for mainstream advertising and other information to reach truckers. To offset this, the OTA will host focus groups, include information in its weekly newsletter and create a short video loaded onto CD’s and distributed through truck stops across the state.</p>" +
                "<p>“The trucking industry offers a nontraditional working environment with its own unique set of health needs. Affordable and easy to use health insurance is critical for Oregon’s smaller trucking companies,” said Debra Dunn, President of the Oregon Trucking Association. “We are pleased to be able to work with Cover Oregon to not only share information about the benefits of Cover Oregon with Oregon’s trucking companies, but to help Cover Oregon learn more about a vital business sector that drives Oregon’s economy.”</p>" +
                "<p>Cover Oregon’s online health insurance marketplace will allow small businesses with 50 or fewer employees to provide their employees with a broad selection of easy-to-compare medical and dental plan options. Employers will also have the option of contributing a set dollar amount toward their employees’ health insurance coverage and let employees shop on Cover Oregon for the insurance carrier and plan that best meets their needs. Once enrollment is complete, Cover Oregon is responsible for billing, reconciliation and renewal activity. Instead of receiving multiple bills from various carriers, the employer will receive a single monthly bill from Cover Oregon, easing administrative burden and costs.</p>" +
                "<p>On CoverOregon.com small businesses can browse plan options and find a certified agent to help with enrollment. Businesses can opt to have their benefits begin any month of the year.</p>" +
