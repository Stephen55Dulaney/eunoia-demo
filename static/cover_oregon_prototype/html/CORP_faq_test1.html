Question: "How will Cover Oregon select and certify assisters?",

Rather than using the term “navigator,” Cover Oregon uses the term “assister” to encompass navigators, in-person assisters, and application counselors. Assisters will lead individuals and families through the entire process of eligibility and enrollment for public and private health coverage through Cover Oregon. Community partner organizations that choose to have staff or volunteers serve as assisters will need to sign agreements with the Oregon Health Authority, whether or not the organization receives a grant to do this work. To be certified as an assister, staff or volunteers at community partner organizations must pass a criminal background check, complete an online overview about Cover Oregon, attend in-person enrollment assistance training, pass a certification exam and have liability and automobile insurance.

Question: "Why can’t community partners and assisters receive a commission?",
Answer: "Community partners assist individuals and families with enrollment and disenrollment processes related to health coverage. These activities do not typically earn a commission. In general, activities that earn a commission—like assisting with carrier claims—are done by an agent rather than a community partner. To help support outreach and enrollment assistance by community partners, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) will provide grant funding to some community partner organizations on behalf of Cover Oregon. OHA hopes to provide grants to a large pool of diverse community organizations, but not all organizations will qualify for a grant.

OHA hopes to provide grants to a large pool of diverse community organizations, but not all organizations will qualify for a grant. All community partner organizations will, however, be able to sign an agreement with OHA to provide application assistance. Cover Oregon will provide a link to apply for these grant opportunities on the Cover Oregon website. Interested parties can also e-mail communitypartner@coveroregon.com to request more information."

Question: "What is the Tribal Premium Sponsorship Program (TPSP)?",
Answer: "TPSP is a program created under the Affordable Care Act that allows Tribes and Tribal organizations to pay private insurance premiums on behalf of individuals. Tribes can choose who they wish to sponsor premiums for, regardless of whether the person is an American Indian or Alaska Native."
},
{
ID:156,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Why do I need to provide coverage dates for the individuals our Tribe is sponsoring through TPSP?",
Answer: "You need to provide coverage dates to identify the coverage period for the individuals your Tribe will be sponsoring. Coverage for your sponsored individual(s) begins on the date of enrollment and continues through the end of that calendar year."
},
{
ID:157,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Do we choose the same insurance plan for all of the individuals we are sponsoring under TPSP, or can we offer more than one plan?",
Answer: "You can offer more than one plan. Tribes can sponsor premiums for any insurance carrier they choose, and they have the added flexibility to sponsor metal levels or specific plans. "
},
{
ID:158,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "What if I want to change the plans available for the individuals we're sponsoring under TPSP?",
Answer: "Once a sponsored individual has enrolled in a specific plan, only that individual can change his or her plan. However, you can add, remove or change the type of plans you make available to future TPSP-sponsored individuals at any time."
},
{
ID:159,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "We aren’t ready to enroll in TPSP today, but we plan to in the future. Is there a time limit for signing up?",
Answer: "You may enroll in TPSP at any time. Coverage for the individuals you have chosen to sponsor will begin on the date you enroll them and continue through the end of that calendar year."
},
{
ID:160,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "If we enroll in TPSP now, can we opt out later? ",
Answer: "Once you enroll in TPSP, you are committed to sponsoring the individuals you’ve selected through the remainder of the calendar year. At the end of the year, you can opt not to renew coverage for some or all of the individuals on your list."
},
{
ID:161,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Will our TPSP-sponsored individuals have to change providers, or will they be able to use their health insurance at Tribal clinics?",
Answer: "The individuals you sponsor under TPSP will have access to any of the providers listed in their insurance plan. They can also continue to receive services through IHS and Tribal clinics without paying any out-of-pocket costs."
},
{
ID:162,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Will TPSP sponsorship automatically renew, or will we need to renew manually for each individual we’re sponsoring?",
Answer: "No, your TPSP sponsorship will not automatically renew, but you can renew coverage through the Tribal dashboard."
},
{
ID:163,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "We already have a list with Tribal member information. Can I just send that to Cover Oregon, or do I need to use the membership form on Cover Oregon’s website? ",
Answer: "To make sure our information is as complete and accurate as possible, we need Tribes to use the Tribal Community Information Form provided. If you are not participating in TPSP, you can also choose to verify your Tribal members manually. You can select your preferred method of verification when you register your Tribe with Cover Oregon."
},
{
ID:164,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "If I am sponsored under TPSP, will my Tribe help with out-of-pocket expenses too?",
Answer: "With TPSP, your Tribe pays for the monthly insurance premium and you are responsible for out-of-pocket costs. Depending on your income, American Indians or Alaska Natives may not have to pay for any cost sharing. When you receive services through Indian Health Services or a Tribal Clinic, there are never any out-of-pocket costs."
},
{
ID:165,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Why can’t I find my Tribe in the list of federally recognized Tribes?",
Answer: "Cover Oregon has loaded each one of the 566 federally recognized Tribes into our system. State-recognized Tribes and Tribes outside of the United States don’t qualify for benefits through Cover Oregon. If you’re certain your Tribe is federally recognized, check to see if you might be spelling your Tribe’s name in a different way than we have it listed."
},
{
ID:166,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Will my Tribe verify my enrollment status, or do I need to do that?",
Answer: "In some cases, your Tribe will assist with verifying your enrollment status. However, it’s your responsibility to provide documentation of your status to Cover Oregon within 90 days of signing up for coverage."
},
{
ID:167,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "How do I document my American Indian or Alaska Native heritage?",
Answer: "If you are an enrolled member of a federally recognized Tribe, you will have 90 days to provide documentation that confirms your enrollment. Without proof, Cover Oregon will remove these additional benefits. Cover Oregon will accept the following documents as confirmation of your Tribal membership: a Tribal enrollment card, a Tribal passport or a letter from your Tribe confirming that you are a member. The Oregon Health Plan and Healthy Kids may not require documentation."
},
{
ID:168,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "I don’t file taxes. Do I still need to accept the tax credit to be sponsored under TPSP?",
Answer: "Yes. In order to be sponsored under TPSP, you will need to accept the tax credit. This means that if you haven’t filed taxes before, you will need to file them for the year you are receiving coverage. Most communities have programs that offer no-cost assistance with filing your taxes."
},
{
ID:169,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "I’m a Tribal member, but I’m not currently enrolled. Can I still access benefits through Cover Oregon?",
Answer: "Only enrolled members of a federally recognized Tribe may access the special benefits available through Cover Oregon. If you are a descendant of an enrolled member of a federally recognized Tribe, you may be eligible for Medicaid benefits."
},
{
ID:170,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "I have already submitted proof of my American Indian or Alaska Native status for Medicaid (or other federal program). Why do I need to give proof of my status again?",
Answer: "Different programs define American Indian or Alaska Native status in different ways. In order to access the special benefits available through Cover Oregon, you must be able to document your status according to specific guidelines."
},
{
ID:171,
Category: "Tribal Organization",
Question: "Now that I have a private health insurance plan, how do I find out which medical providers I can visit? Can I still go to my Tribal clinic? ",
Answer: "Your insurance carrier will provide you with a list of participating doctors and other health providers in your plan. You can also continue to get services through your Tribal health clinic."
