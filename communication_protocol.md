# Communication Protocol for Eunoia Research Council

## 1. Message Format

- **Structure**: JSON
- **Fields**:
  - `sender`: The agent sending the message.
  - `receiver`: The agent intended to receive the message.
  - `type`: The type of message (e.g., `command`, `response`, `event`).
  - `content`: The actual content of the message, which can vary based on the message type.
  - `timestamp`: The time the message was sent.

## 2. Data Structures

- **Shared Data Store**:
  - Use a structured database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store shared data.
  - Define tables for different types of data (e.g., `projects`, `interviews`, `personas`).
  - Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

- **Event Bus**:
  - Define events that agents can emit and subscribe to.
  - Events should include metadata such as `event_type`, `source`, `timestamp`, and `payload`.

## 3. Flow Diagrams

- **Agent Interaction Flow**:
  - Eunoia initiates a research project.
  - Synthia creates a discovery plan.
  - Askia generates interview scripts.
  - Eurekia synthesizes insights.

- **Data Flow**:
  - Diagram how data flows between agents and the shared data store.
  - Highlight key data transformations and storage points.

## 4. Error Handling and Retry Logic

- **Error Types**:
  - Define common error types (e.g., `communication_error`, `data_error`).
  - Specify how each error type should be handled.

- **Retry Logic**:
  - Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed operations.
  - Define maximum retry attempts and timeouts.

## 5. Security and Access Control

- **Authentication**:
  - Use token-based authentication for agent interactions.
  - Define roles and permissions for each agent.

- **Authorization**:
  - Specify which agents can access which data and perform which actions.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

- **Logging**:
  - Define log levels (e.g., `info`, `warning`, `error`).
  - Specify what information should be logged for each level.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Set up monitoring tools to track agent activity and system performance.
  - Define metrics to monitor (e.g., message latency, error rates).
